- [ ] Components
	- [ ] **Master**
		- [ ] Distrubutes the work among identical slave components and computes a final result from the results which the slaves return
	- [ ] **Slave**
		- [ ] compute and return result to master
- [ ] Advantages
	- [ ] Accuracy - The execution of a service is delegated to different slaves, with diffrenet implementations.
- [ ] Disadvantages
	- [ ] Slaves are **isolated**, no shared state
	- [ ] **latency** in master-slave communication 
	- [ ] can only be applied to a problem **that can be decomposed**
- [ ] Usage
	- [ ] In database replication
		- [ ] master database is authoritative source andslave are synched to it.
