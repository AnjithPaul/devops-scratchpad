## App Mesh

### [What](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html)
infrastructure layer dedicated to handling **service-to-service communication**, usually through an array of lightweight **network** **proxies** deployed **alongside the application** code

### Why
- Decouples communication management logic from application code
- end-to-end visibility into service-level logs, metrics and traces
- Manage all service to service traffic using one set of APIs regardless of how the services are implemented.
- Minimises the inconsistencies between services and how they interact with each other, as you can roll out changes to all without requiring deployments of individual applications.
