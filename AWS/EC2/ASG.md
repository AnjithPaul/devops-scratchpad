## Auto Scaling Group
- [ ] **Scale out/in** ec2 instances dynamically
- [ ] Re create terminated ec2 instance
- [ ] minimum, desire, maximum
- [ ] **Launch Template**
	- [ ] AMI + Instance Type
	- [ ] EC2 User Data
	- [ ] EBS Volume
	- [ ] SG
	- [ ] SSH key pair
	- [ ] IAM role
	- [ ] Network + subnet
	- [ ] LB information
- [ ] Scaling policy
	- [ ] **Target Tracking** Scaling
		- [ ] e.g: Average ASG CPU should stay around 40%
	- [ ] **Simple / Step** Scaling
		- [ ] e.g: When cloudwatch alarm is triggered (CPU >70%), then add 2 units
	- [ ] **Scheduled** Actions
		- [ ] Increase mic capacity to 10 at 5pm on fridays
	- [ ] **Predictive** Scaling
		- [ ] Based on historical data forecast load and schedule scaling ahead
- [ ] Good Metrics to scale on 
	- [ ] CPUUtilization
	- [ ] RequestCountPerTarget
	- [ ] Average Network In/Out
- [ ] Scaling Cooldown
	- [ ] after scaling activity there is **cooldown period** (default 300 sec)
	- [ ] During cooldown, ASG will not launch/terminate additional instances (to allow metrics to **stabilize**)
